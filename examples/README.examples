These examples can be run 
at the command line.  If perl is
not in /usr/bin/perl, they can be run with
"perl name"

They are also called by the test.pl script.
For this reason some of the variables in a script
are made local when there is no apparant reason.

Some of them take the device type as an optional argument.

eg,
ccurve X
ccurve ps

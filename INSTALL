libplot-perl
In order to build this package, you need the libplot library to
be built and installed.  It is part of the plotutils package,
available wherever fine FSF products are sold. You need the plot.h
header file as well.

On some systems, the module will build with

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

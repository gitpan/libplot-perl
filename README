This is a perl module which allows the libplot plotting 
routines to be called from the perl scripting language.
libplot currently takes relatively primitive graphics commands.
Several output formats, including xfig, postscript and
an X11 driver are available.

In order to build this package, you need the libplot library to
be built and installed.  It is part of the plotutils package,
available wherever fine FSF products are sold. 
http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/plotutils.html
You need the plot.h header file as well as the
shared library.

On some systems, the module will build with

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

This has been tested under Debian Gnu/Linux and 
on a DEC Alpha running Digital Unix.

In the source tree is a directory, "examples" with
a readme and some sample scripts.

The interface may change.  libplot is under development.
I plan make new functions available in libplot-perl. 
Currently, there are no libplot functions operating on
arrays.  When these become available, I will add an
interface for the perl PDL module, ie, the functions
in libplot-perl will take PDL data types (pdl's)
as arguments.  Please let me know if you plan to
make anything more or less permanent depend on
a libplot-perl.

The version number of libplot-perl consists of the 
libplot version number with a point and a number appended.

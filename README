libplot-perl

This is a perl module which allows the libplot plotting 
routines to be called from the perl scripting language.

In order to build this package, you need the libplot library to
be built and installed.  It is part of the plotutils package,
available wherever fine FSF products are sold. You need the plot.h
header file as well.

On some systems, the module will build with

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install


In the source tree is a directory, "examples" with
a readme and some sample scripts.
